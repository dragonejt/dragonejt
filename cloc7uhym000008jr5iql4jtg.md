Over this past weekend, I helped with the 2023 edition of [sunhacks](https://sunhacks.io/) at Arizona State University virtually. I was managing the [DevPost](https://sunhacks-2023.devpost.com/), answering hackers' questions on Discord, and putting out fires in general. It was a pretty fun experience and I was glad to be back in the company of friends doing what we were best at, but it was also insightful how little I (and virtual organizers/volunteers) can do as hackathons transition back to being in-person.

## From "Organizer" to "Associate"

My first experience with sunhacks was in the fall of my sophomore year, at sunhacks 2020 (or 4.0 as the organizers called it). This was the first hackathon that I had attended, and since COVID-19 had just burst onto the scene in the previous semester, the hackathon was completely virtual, hosted on a platform called Hopin (remember Hopin?). Although I did not win any prizes that year, that event left me enamored with hackathons and I continued to attend more with friends. I was interested in the prizes, sure, but more so in the workshops and activities hosted as a chance to learn new things and further immerse myself in the tech community. Soon, when I received a recruitment email from the organizers the next spring, I signed up to be an organizer.

We started planning for sunhacks 2021 (5.0), and soon activities began in earnest to the hackathon a reality. sunhacks is divided into different departments, such as finance, operations, marketing, hacker experience, and tech. Although I was a Computer Science student, I found interest in workshops and activities that I loved and joined the hacker experience team, which focuses on mentoring, workshops/activities, prizes, and judging. We focused on a hybrid hackathon with both in-person and virtual attendees, since COVID had become less of a threat. By all accounts, sunhacks 2021 was a resounding success. I enjoyed speaking at the opening ceremony, coordinating some workshops and activities, determining prizes and prize categories, and finally judging.
